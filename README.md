# Scientific Calculator
 
A scientific calculator built with TypeScript that supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), unary operations (square root, factorial, trigonometric functions), and constants like `π` and `e`. It also includes error handling, a history feature, and keyboard input support.
